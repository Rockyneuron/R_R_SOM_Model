% %%%Description:
% A mathematical model of the development of correctly oriented topographic
% maps in visual cortex is presented that takes into account the 
% synchronization between the two retinas mediated by retino-retinal 
% projections and the effect of the molecular guidance cues.
% 
% We used a simplified model of self-organizing map (SOM) as described by
% Kohonen [1] and a modified version of the script from the book [2]
% For more detailed information about the model refer to the paper[3].
